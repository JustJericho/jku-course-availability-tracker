# jku-course-availability-tracker
I got mad at the klunky JKU KUSS website, so I programmed my own klunkier python program to track the availability of my bachelor courses that I will most probably not register in because they're always so overfilled :)



Program has sloppy built in input prompt, but you can always parse a command line argument!
In order to use the program you have to have BeautifulSoup, so go ahead and install that bad boi.
Good luck to the potential JKU students! May the best man win ;) 


TLDR;
Use as follows:
  python jku-course-tracker.py https://www.kusss.jku.at/kusss/lvaregistrationlist.action?courseclass=46713
Where 
  python *name of file* *link to the course on kuss*
